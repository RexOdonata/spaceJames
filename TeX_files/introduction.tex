\chapter{Introduction}

Project James is a community ruleset that brings together the classic features of Dropfleet Commander 1.0 by Hawk Wargames and Dropfleet Commander 2.0 by Tabletop Combat. The aim of Project James is not to revert from 2.0 to 1.0, but blend some of the streamlining improvements of the former with some of the characteristic mechanics of the latter.
\\\\
\textbf{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Focus on the impactful decisions behind controlling your fleet
	\item Reduce or eliminate time spent in redundant mechanics
	\item Create more opportunities for balanced tactical play without adding unnecessary complexity
	\item Remain recognizable to Dropfleet Commander players
\end{itemize}

As a community project, this ruleset exists for the members of the player base that want an evolution of the Dropfleet Commander ruleset, as such feedback is welcome and appreciated. There are many designer intent or commentary notes in this document, please read the designer intent for a given rule change or addition before giving related feedback.
\\\\
The Project James ruleset is paired with ship profiles re-statted and re-balanced for Project James. Commentary will be given with each ship as to any substantial changes made from the design of the 1.7 profiles.
