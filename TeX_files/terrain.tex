\section{Debris Fields}
Debris Fields are areas on the map that impede weapons targeting and can potentially damage ships and launch assets.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Lock Penalty} & \textbf{Scan Penalty} & \textbf{Damage} & \textbf{Launch Hazard} \\
	\hline
	Fine & -1 & 6" & 1 & 4$\triangledown$ \\
	\hline
	\gray Dense & -2 & 12" & 3 & 2$\triangledown$ \\
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
Ships that move through a Debris Field take damage which can be saved against. Assets that enter a Debris Field roll a hazard check for each asset. Each failed roll removes one asset.
\section{Planetary Rings}

Planetary Rings are thin lines that run from one edge of the board to another in orbit. Planetary rings impose a 6" scan penalty to any weapons range measured across them.

\section{LSO}
Large Solid Objects (LSOs) are areas of the map which completely block line of sight and movement in orbit. If any ship moves into contact with a LSO, it is destroyed by hazard damage.
