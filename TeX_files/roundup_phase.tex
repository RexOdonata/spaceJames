\chapter{Roundup Phase}

In the roundup phase, check for any end of turn victory points and initiate repairs. Any repairable status effect a ship has in the `completed' state are removed.

\endnote{As noted previously rolling for damage control was a very swingy part of the game that was often forgotten, and without much player interaction. The changes here remove the rolling and make all repairable effects just last for one turn always. The `states' mean that ships have to complete at least one activation with a temporary status for them to be removed, including a launch phase. My hope is that in practice it isn't that complex, just mark each status effect a ship had at the end of its activation for removal, except for anything it suffered during the activation.}
