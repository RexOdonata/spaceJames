\chapter{Planning Phase}

In the planning phase players `set' their strategy deck by choosing an order for the cards in their deck and placing it face down. The top card in the deck will be the first Battlegroup activated and the bottom card in the deck will be the last to activate.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cards currently waiting to activate are in the deck.
	\item The card a player has most recently flipped is an \underline{active} card.
	\item Cards that have been activated are placed in the \underline{spent} pile until set back into the deck or discarded.
\end{itemize}
Any Strategy Cards in the spent pile are removed if their representative Battlegroup has been destroyed.
\\\\
When both players have set their strategy decks, move onto the Activation Phase.
