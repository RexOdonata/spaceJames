\subsubsection{Detector (X)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Detector ships may always use Active Scan special orders even if outside of battlegroup cohesion or their battlegroup has chosen a different special order.
    \item Every Detector ship in a squadron may active scan, not just one.
    \item For the purposes of Active Scanning, this ship uses X as its scan instead of its own Scan characteristic.
    \item While suffering Statuses that reduce scan range, ships lose the benefits of this rule.
\end{itemize}
