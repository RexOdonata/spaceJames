\subsubsection{Crippling}
When a weapon system with this rule scores at least one critical hit and deals unsaved damage, the target must roll on the crippling table and apply the result. This roll does not give the ship the crippled status and the ship may be normally crippled if in the future its hull is reduced to its crippling point. If this weapon reduces an enemy hull to where a crippling roll would normally be made, the normal crippling roll is performed in addition to the bonus crippling roll that can be inflicted using this rule.
