\subsubsection{Dreadnought}
\begin{itemize}
\item A battlegroup containing a dreadnought may not contain any other ships
\item Dreadnaughts cripple at 1/3 and 2/3 hull instead of 1/2. Other effects that consider when a ship is crippled still use the 1/2 cutoff value. \endnote{Trying to reduce the differentiation between battleships and dreadnoughts, so again, less special stuff for dreads}
\end{itemize}
