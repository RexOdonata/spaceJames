\subsubsection{Burnthrough}
When a weapon with Burnthrough scores an armor piercing critical hit against a target, all hits rolled by that weapon are considered armor piercing as well.
\endnote{Since armor piercing crits are back, BTL can now go back to locking in multiple crits. as a tool to crack open armored ships. This still requires each BTL weapon to be rolled seperately but should be faster and less swingy than the 1.0 BTL mechanics while still satisfiying the feeling of going hot by landing a perfect BTL critical hit}
