\subsubsection{Coordinated}
When a squadron of ships uses multiple weapons with the Coordinated rule, all ships may elect to use Coordinated Fire. Ships using Coordinated Fire collectively gain 1 Multi-Targeting target per coordinating ship, and the total PD value of targeted enemies against this attack is reduced by 1 per coordinating ship beyond the first. \endnote{This is the replacement rule to squadron, but rather than adding random attacks it has more determinstic benefits}
