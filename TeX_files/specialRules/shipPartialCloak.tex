\subsubsection{Partial-Cloak}

A ship with the Partial Cloak special rule can only ever receive a Minor Spike - it may never be increased to a Major Spike. If a rule or weapon would cause this ship to gain Major Spike, it instead gains a Minor Spike (or nothing at all if it already has a Minor Spike). This rule ceases to work when the ship is Crippled.
