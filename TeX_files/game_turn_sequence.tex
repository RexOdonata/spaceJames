\chapter{Game Turn Sequence}

Each turn consists of the following phases.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Planning Phase
	\item Activation Phase
	\item Troop Phase
	\item Launch Phase
	\item Roundup Phase
\end{enumerate}

The planning phase consists of players setting their Strategy Decks. These decks determine the order in which ships will activate. The planning phase is asynchronous, and ends when both players are ready.
\\\\
The Activation phase is where the bulk of combat occurs. Players will both activate one Battlegroup card at a time. The activation phase lasts until both players have activated all Battlegroups.
\\\\
The Troop Phase is when Troop tokens and ground/station features activate. This phase lasts until every ground or space station feature and Troop activates, and is light on player interactions.
\\\\
The Asset Phase is when ships deploy launch assets. Depending on launch asset type and distance to target, effects of launch assets may be resolved. This phase ends when all carriers have either launched all payload or passed, and when all required effects have been resolved.
\\\\
The Roundup Phase is victory points are collected, as well as any specific end of turn conditions relevant to the scenario.
